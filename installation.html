<h2>Installation guide</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>What does it require for you to be able to run JSIS?</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a></li>
	<li>Node.js modules: ejs, iconv (iconv is actually not strictly necessary)</li>
	<li>Log files in supported format</li>
	<li>Some basic skills at running command line tools</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to use it?</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
		Make sure you have installed Node.js and Node Package Manager<br />

		<p>
			You can probably install them via some installer from the <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js homepage</a>, or with <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">Node Version Manager</a>. Ask them for more help.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		You'll need a place to put the application in, and to run it on .. think of one, and then download the source code from the <a href="https://github.com/lietu/jsis">GitHub project page</a> and put the code there.
	</li>
	<li>
		Install the node modules "ejs" and "iconv".<br />
		<p>
			Assuming you've got Node Package Manager installed properly and use BASH, you can open a terminal/whatever to the place you put the files in and run the following:<br />
			<code>modules="ejs iconv"; for module in $modules; do npm install $module; done</code><br />
			<strong>NOTE:</strong> iconv most likely needs to be compiled, might have some requirements (such as a compiler), etc. that I cannot, and will not, help you with.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		Configure JSIS by copying config.example.js to config.js and editing it to taste. Try to read the documentation if something is unclear.
	</li>
	<li>
		Run JSIS with:<br />
		<code>node jsis.js</code>
	</li>
	<li>Good luck! If any issues arise, please report them at the <a href="https://github.com/lietu/jsis/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a> ... if you like it, send thanks to <a href="http://lietu.net">Lietu</a>.</li>
